============

Qwt uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix <span class="stringliteral">"*.pro"</span>. 
Files that end with the suffix <span class="stringliteral">"*.pri"</span> are included by the project 
files and contain definitions, that are common <span class="keywordflow">for</span> several project files.

qwtconfig.pri is read by all project files of the Qwt package.
So the first step is to edit qwtconfig.pri to adjust it to your
needs.

MathML Extension
================

Qwt/Qt4 supports the MathML render engine from the Qt solutions package,
that is only available with a commercial Qt license.

You need a release of qtmmlwidget &gt;= 2.1.
Copy the files qtmmlwidget.[cpp|h] to textengines/mathml.

A) Unix (+ MacOSX) Qt3/Qt4
==========================

qmake
make
make install

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples <span class="keyword">this</span> way:

cd examples
qmake 
make

If you like to run the examples, don't forget to install the 
Qwt library/plugins or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory 
of your local build. ( On some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. )

B) Win32/MSVC Qt3/Qt4
=====================

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples <span class="keyword">this</span> way:

cd examples
nmake examples.pro
nmake

admin/msvc-qmake.bat helps users of Visual Studio users to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp <span class="keywordflow">for</span> MSVC-6.0 or vcproj <span class="keywordflow">for</span> 
MSVC.NET) <span class="keywordflow">for</span> Qwt.

To generate makefiles, type: <span class="stringliteral">"admin\msvc-qmake"</span>
To generate project files, type: <span class="stringliteral">"admin\msvc-qmake vc"</span>

C) Win32/MinGW Qt4
==================

C1) Windows Shell

Start a Windows Shell, where Qt4 is initialized. ( F.e. with
<span class="stringliteral">"Programs-&gt;Qt by Trolltech ...-&gt;Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt"</span> ).

qmake qwt.pro
make

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples <span class="keyword">this</span> way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
make
make install

C2) MSYS Shell Qt &gt;= 4.3.0

Support <span class="keywordflow">for</span> the MSYS Shell has been improved in Qt 4.3.0. 
Now building Qwt from the MSYS Shell works exactly like UNIX or in the 
Windows Shell.

C3) MSYS Shell Qt &lt; 4.3.0

For Qt &lt; 4.3.0 you have to set the MINGW_IN_SHELL variable. 
make will run into errors with the subdirs target, that can be 
ignored (make -i).

export MINGW_IN_SHELL=1;

qmake 
make -i
make -i install

If you didn't enable autobuilding of the examples in qwtconfig.pri
you have to build the examples <span class="keyword">this</span> way:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
make -i
make -i install

D) MacOSX

Well, the Mac is only another Unix system. So read the instructions in A).


D) Qtopia Core

I only tested Qwt with Qtopia Core in qvfb (Virtual Framebuffer Devivce)
Emulator on my Linux box. To build Qwt <span class="keywordflow">for</span> the emulator was as simple as 
<span class="keywordflow">for</span> a regular Unix build.

qmake
make

E) Qtopia (!= Qtopia Core)

I once compiled the Qwt library against Qtopia 4.2.0 successfully - but
not more. It should be possible to build and install Qwt, but it's
not done yet.

Good luck !
